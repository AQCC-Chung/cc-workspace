## 2026-03-01 - Added CTA link to empty Flights page\n**Learning:** The empty state placeholder lacked a call-to-action (CTA), trapping users. We added a 'Back to Home' link and styled it properly for keyboard accessibility.\n**Action:** Whenever creating empty state placeholders (like 'Coming Soon'), always provide a way out (e.g. a link to home or a previous page) with clear interactive styles and accessibility considerations.
